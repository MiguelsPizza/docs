## Quick Start

The MCP-B Native Host enables your browser extension to communicate with local MCP clients like Claude Code. Follow these three simple steps to get started.

## 1. Install the Browser Extension

Install the MCP-B browser extension from the Chrome Web Store:

## 2. Install the Native Host

Install the native host package using npm. **You must use npm** (not pnpm or yarn) to ensure the post-install script runs correctly:

```bash
npm install -g @mcp-b/native-server
```

The post-install script automatically registers the native messaging host with your browser.

<Note>
  The native host must be installed globally (`-g` flag) to function properly.
</Note>

## 3. Connect to an MCP Client

Once installed, configure your MCP client to use the native host. Here are examples for common clients:

### Claude Code

Add the MCP server to your Claude Code configuration:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio native-host -- npx @mcp-b/native-server
```

Or manually edit your `~/.claude.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "native-host": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@mcp-b/native-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP Clients

For other MCP clients, add a server configuration with:

- **Command**: `npx`
- **Args**: `["@mcp-b/native-server"]`
- **Transport**: `stdio`

## Verification

To verify the installation:

1. Check that the native host is installed:
```bash
npm list -g @mcp-b/native-server
```

2. Restart your browser after installation

3. Open your MCP client and confirm the connection

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="Extension can't connect to native host">
    Ensure you installed using npm (not pnpm/yarn) and that the package is installed globally with the `-g` flag.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Post-install script didn't run">
    Manually run the registration:
    ```bash
    cd $(npm root -g)/@mcp-b/native-server
    npm run postinstall
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="MCP client can't find the server">
    Verify the command path:
    ```bash
    which npx
    ```
    Use the full path in your configuration if needed.
